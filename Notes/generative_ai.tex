\section*{Guidelines for Using Generative AI (February 2024)}

Generative AI, such as ChatGPT, is a powerful tool that can assist you in various tasks, including generating text, answering questions, and writing this document\footnote{The draft of this document is generated by ChatGPT 3.5.}.
To make the most out of ChatGPT wile ensuring your academic success and avoiding any negative impact on your learning, please consider the following suggestions from Sho.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item \Emph*{Understand} that generative AI is designed to provide assistance.  In terms of ``naturalness'', its output is natural. However, in terms of ``correctness'', it is usually incorrect, as of Feb.~2024.
 \item \Emph*{Sho encourages} you to use generative AI for the following purposes.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Text translation and summarization. In particular, generative AI is good at improving your writing English sentences.
 \item Content generation. It can give us natural sentences, where you need to check its correctness or validity by your own responsibility.
\end{itemize}
 \item \Emph*{As a formal policy, Sho forbids} you to use generative AI in writing \Emph*{essays\footnote{Tasks involving writing texts.} or programming codes} you submit to me. It is because of the following reasons.
\begin{itemize}
 \item If your answer made by AI is incorrect, it means you distribute fake information to me, which is against \href{https://oaa.nsysu.edu.tw/var/file/3/1003/img/1296/acade_rule_27.pdf}{\em academic ethics}.
\begin{itemize}
 \item In this case, Sho can easily detect your use of generative AI due to its perfect English but scientific inaccuracies, and \Emph*{you may receive negative points} in your evaluation.
\end{itemize}
 \item If your answer made by AI is correct, Sho will overestimate your performance, assuming you have a deeper understanding of the topics than you actually do. The lecture and the exams can be faster and/or more difficult, which probably you do not want.
\begin{itemize}
 \item In this case, you do not receive penalties in your evaluation since it is practically impossible to detect your use of generative AI.
\end{itemize}
 \item You may improve your English sentences by using generative AI, but Sho does not require you to write perfect English. You should first focus on scientific correctness rather than perfection in English proficiency.

\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
For more information, you may read the following articles, which Sho largely agrees with and obeys.
