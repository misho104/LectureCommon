\maketitle
Generative AIs (GAIs), such as ChatGPT, are powerful tools that can assist in various academic tasks\footnote{This document is written with the assistance of ChatGPT.}.
To maximize their benefits while ensuring your academic success and maintaining academic integrity, please consider the following guidelines:

\begin{enumerate}
\item As a formal policy, \Emph{Sho forbids you to use GAIs for writing essays\footnote{Any tasks involving writing texts.} or programming codes you submit to me.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Sho understands that it is nearly impossible to detect your use of generative AI with 100\% confidence.
  Meanwhile, your evaluation may be reduced once Sho gets enough confidence of your use of GAIs.
  Sho reserves the right to give you \Emph{zero or negative score} for your submission.
\end{itemize}
  \item Even with that said, some students will use GAIs. If you decide to use GAIs, you should be aware of the following:
  \begin{itemize}
   \item You are violating the rule and against \href{https://oaa.nsysu.edu.tw/var/file/3/1003/img/1296/acade_rule_27.pdf}{\em academic ethics}.
   \item Sho is aware of common errors/mistakes that GAIs makes.
   \item You must \emph{fully} understand each sentence (or each line of your code). Sho will occasionally ask you to explain your submission orally; inadequate explanations will lead to a negative score.
   \item If your submission written by GAIs contains mistakes, it means you distribute fake information to me, which constitutes another violation of \href{https://oaa.nsysu.edu.tw/var/file/3/1003/img/1296/acade_rule_27.pdf}{\em academic ethics}.
   \item If your submission written by GAIs is correct, Sho will overestimate your performance, assuming you have a deeper understanding of the topics than you actually do, and the exams will be more difficult.
   \item GAIs can help improve your English sentences, but Sho does not require you to write perfect English. Your primary focus should be on science, not language perfection.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Sho encourages you to use GAIs for other activities.
  \begin{itemize}
     \item In particular, you should understand the capabilities and limitations of GAIs. As of June 2024, GAIs' answers look very natural and are mostly correct, but sometimes totally incorrect. It is beneficial for you to experience such situations.
     \item You can use it safely for text translation, summarization, and content generation. There, still, it is you that need to be responsible for the correctness of the output.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
For more information, you may read the following articles, which Sho largely agrees with and obeys.
