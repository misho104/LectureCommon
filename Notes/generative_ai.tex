\begin{document}
\maketitle
Generative AIs (GAIs), such as ChatGPT, are powerful tools that can assist in various academic tasks\footnote{This document is written with the assistance of ChatGPT.}.
To maximize their benefits while ensuring your academic success and maintaining academic integrity, please adhere to the following guidelines.

These regulations are applied to all types of assignments you submit to Sho.
Any violation may result in your submission being graded with \Emph{reduced, zero, or even negative points}.\footnote{%
  It is nearly impossible to detect GAI use with 100\% confidence. On the other hand, Sho reserves the right to give you reduced or negative score for your submission .
}

\subsection*{Regulations on Coding Assignments}
For assignments related to program coding,
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \Emph{You must not copy and paste the problem statements to GAIs.}
        This means you can use GAIs and read their outputs, but you myst type the input statements by yourself.
  \item \Emph{You must not copy (and paste) GAI outputs.}
        You cannot paste \emph{any part of} the output into your editor or any other places like Google.
  \item \Emph{You must type every single character of your code by yourself.}
  \item \Emph{You must fully understand each line of your code.}
  Sho may sometimes ask you to explain your code; if you cannot explain it adequately, you may receive a negative score.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Regulations on Other Assignments}
For other assignments, such as essay or math homework, \Emph{Sho forbids using GAIs}.
Even with that said, some students will use GAIs. If you decide to do so, you must aware that
\begin{itemize}
 \item You are violating the rule and going against \href{https://oaa.nsysu.edu.tw/var/file/3/1003/img/1296/acade_rule_27.pdf}{\em academic ethics}.
  \item If your GAI-generated submission contains mistakes, it means you are distributing fake information to me, which constitutes another violation of \href{https://oaa.nsysu.edu.tw/var/file/3/1003/img/1296/acade_rule_27.pdf}{\em academic ethics}.
  \item If your GAI-generated submission is correct, Sho will overestimate your performance, assuming you have a deeper understanding than you actually do, leading to more difficult exams.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Other Remarks}
Sho encourages you to use GAIs for other activities.
\emph{We} should understand their capabilities and limitations.
As of July 2024, GAIs seem highly effective in coding tasks or enhancing your English writing.
Meanwhile, in scientific fields, they often generate totally incorrect answers.
It is beneficial for you to experience them through proper use of GAIs.
